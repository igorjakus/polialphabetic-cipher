# Vigenere cipher encryptor and decryptor
## 1. You have to type text for cipher and encryption key

## 2. All useless (not alphabetical) characters will be deleted

## 3. All the letters are changed for shifts:

a for shift = 1

b for shift = 2

c for shift = 3

and so on.. then:

z for shift = 0

## 4. For each letter in the text there's shift.

## 5. Shift the letter.
Examples:

A + 4 = E

Z - 2 = X

## 5. When list with shifts (keyword list) ends it goes to the start of list.
Example:

meet me at elephant lake

snak es na kesnakes nake

for text "meet me at elephant lake", and keyword "snake"

## 6. And so on to the end:)
